## Milestone

A text document called milestone.txt with your name and the name of your partner (if any), the project that you've chosen, and a brief description of your plans for your game. One paragraph will suffice for the description. Also, include a description of the objective of the game - and how we should run it!

In addition, your document should give instructions for playing the game as it currently operates, e.g. "Pressing the "s" key will do one thing, the mouse will allow the user to do another thing, etc."

Implementation of enough of the functions, with docstrings, that the game does something interesting (even if it is far short of the complete implementation) in a file called milestone.py -- in fact, if your file is named something else, this is completely OK -- just note how we should run it in your milestone.txt file.

Specifically, your program should include at least some "linear" collisions (a point object with a plane or a line) and at least some "spherical" collisions (a point object with another point object)
Include any other files needed to test your game, as well... all of these should be zipped into vpython_milestone.zip and submitted.
